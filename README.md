Universitat Oberta de Catalunya

This Final Master Thesis aimed at detecting anomalous prices at hotel booking prices in the city of Valencia (on the east side of Spain). It was analysed if they were justified by some kind of relevant event that took place in the city, such as congresses, fairs, concerts, sporting events, or leisure activities between others.
To carry out this project, room prices were collected making a daily scrap of the hotels on Booking.com during several months, as well as obtaining a list of the most important
social events that took place in the city by consulting many different sites on the web.

You can refer to www.booking.com to better understand booking dataset.
